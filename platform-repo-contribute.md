# Contributing to a Platform Repository
Firstly, thanks!  The platform is a team effort.  Contributions to the platform should be done in the same way in which you would do with an Open Source repository.

  1. Fork the repository to your personal namespace.  For example; I would fork `techops-platform/platform-app-gocd-kube` to `Stono/platform-app-gocd-kube`.
  2. Make your changes, keeping in mind the [Convention for Platform Repo Structure](platform-repo-convention.md)
  3. Submit a merge request back to the upstream `techops-platform` repository.
  4. Once accepted, delete your fork.
